 Supply chain attacks have become a notable menace to the software sector, resulting in extensive harm and penetration. These attacks capitalize on vulnerabilities within the security protocols of third-party suppliers, resulting in widespread security breaches that can have extensive repercussions for both the suppliers and cloud service providers associated to them. A considerable amount of investigation has been carried out regarding the origins of these attacks, yielding detailed accounts of significant incidents such as the SolarWinds breach. Nevertheless, there is still a necessity for comprehensive visualization tools to aid in predicting future vulnerabilities based on past patterns. To address this gap, this research introduces a distinctive approach to monitoring the evolution of supply chain attacks targeting major third-party suppliers. We also incorporate dependency-oriented vulnerability assessments to enhance threat identification and mitigation.
