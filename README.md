 Supply chain attacks have become a notable menace to the software sector, resulting in extensive harm and penetration. These attacks capitalize on vulnerabilities within the security protocols of third-party suppliers, resulting in widespread security breaches that can have extensive repercussions for both the suppliers and cloud service providers associated to them. A considerable amount of investigation has been carried out regarding the origins of these attacks, yielding detailed accounts of significant incidents such as the SolarWinds breach. Nevertheless, there is still a necessity for comprehensive visualization tools to aid in predicting future vulnerabilities based on past patterns. To address this gap, this research introduces a distinctive approach to monitoring the evolution of supply chain attacks targeting major third-party suppliers. We also incorporate dependency-oriented vulnerability assessments to enhance threat identification and mitigation.

  1. While extensive research has been conducted on the detection and prevention of supply chain attacks,primary focus here is on providing a detailed vulnerability visualization dashboard. 
  2. Exploration the results and usage of the common vulnerability detection tool, npm audit.  This visualizer will present detailed information about identified vulnerabilities in a more accessible and interpretable format. 
  3. Moreover, the study encompasses the creation of a predictive model for evaluating the seriousness of identified vulnerabilities, leveraging historical data and machine learning methodologies to anticipate the potential consequences of new vulnerabilities. In addition to assessing severity, the model will offer recommendations for detection and mitigation strategies, aiming to raise awareness among vendors and assist them in adopting proactive measures to mitigate the adverse impacts of supply chain attacks in computing ecosystems.
